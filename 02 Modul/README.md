## Database diagram

SQL database diagram is a visual representation of the tables, relationships, and constraints in a database. 

It is a way to design and document a database in a clear and organized way. 
The diagram includes boxes for tables, lines connecting the boxes to represent relationships between tables, and symbols to show keys, indexes, and other database objects. 

The diagram can be used by database designers, developers, and administrators to understand the structure of the database and make changes to it. It can also be used to communicate the database design to others who may need to use or modify the database.


## Normalization

SQL normalization is a process of organizing data in a database to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity. In simple terms, it is a set of rules that help in designing a database that is efficient and organized. The purpose of normalization is to eliminate any data redundancy and ensure that data is stored logically, efficiently, and consistently.

There are different levels of normalization:
	* First Normal Form (1NF): Ensures that each table has a primary key and that every column contains atomic values (i.e., not multi-valued).
	* Second Normal Form (2NF): Requires that the table is in 1NF and every non-key column is dependent on the primary key.
	* Third Normal Form (3NF): Requires that the table is in 2NF and that there are no transitive dependencies.


The normalization process is important because it helps in reducing data redundancy and inconsistencies, which can lead to data inconsistency, performance issues, and update anomalies. A well-normalized database is easier to maintain and update, and provides a better foundation for data analysis and reporting.


## SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language that is used to manage and manipulate data in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

In simple terms, SQL is used to create, modify, and extract data from a database. It allows users to interact with the data stored in the database by performing various operations like creating tables, inserting data into tables, updating existing data, and deleting data from tables.

SQL uses a set of commands or queries to perform these operations. These queries are used to manipulate the data in the database, retrieve data from the database, and perform calculations on the data. SQL also provides various features like data filtering, sorting, and grouping.

SQL is widely used in various applications and industries, including web development, data analysis, and business intelligence. It is a powerful and flexible language that enables users to manage and manipulate data efficiently and effectively.
