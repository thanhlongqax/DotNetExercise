/*
 * With the help of a While loop, create a simple program that will:
 *  - Ask for the input of two numbers and one operator (+,-,/,*) 
 *  - All inputs must be validated:
 *      - If validation fails, loop must restart
 *      - If validation is successful, program will preform calculation between number based on the selected operator
 *  - After every loop iteration ask if user wants to exit with simple (yes/no):
 *      - if user enters "yes" then loop ends
 *      - if user does not enter "yes", loop continues to iterate
